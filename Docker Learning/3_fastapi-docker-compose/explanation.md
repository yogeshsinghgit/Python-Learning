Step by step and explaination of **each part** of this `docker-compose.yml` file, which runs a **FastAPI app (`web`) and a PostgreSQL DB (`db`)**.

---

## ‚úÖ File Header

```yaml
version: "3.9"
```

* This specifies the **Docker Compose file format version**.
* `3.9` is one of the latest and stable versions, compatible with recent Docker versions.
* It defines how features like networks, services, volumes behave.

---

## ‚úÖ Services Section

This is the core of your app. You‚Äôre defining **two services**: `web` (FastAPI app) and `db` (PostgreSQL DB).

---

### üöÄ `web` service (your FastAPI app)

```yaml
  web:
    build: .
```

* Tells Docker to **build the image from the Dockerfile** in the **current directory (`.`)**.
* The Dockerfile should install FastAPI, copy your code, etc.

```yaml
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

* Maps **port 8000 of the container to 8000 on your host**.
* So when the app runs inside the container at `0.0.0.0:8000`, you can access it via `localhost:8000`.

```yaml
    depends_on:
      - db
```

* This makes Docker **start the `db` container before** the `web` container.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **It does *not* wait for DB to be *ready*** ‚Äî just that the container is running.
* Use a `wait-for-it.sh` script or retry logic in FastAPI for true readiness.

```yaml
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/mydb
```

* Sets the `DATABASE_URL` **environment variable inside the web container**.
* `user:pass` = DB credentials
* `db:5432` = connect to `db` container on port 5432 (Docker Compose does internal DNS resolution)
* `mydb` = name of the database

---

### üõ¢ `db` service (PostgreSQL)

```yaml
  db:
    image: postgres:15
```

* Uses the official **PostgreSQL 15 Docker image**.
* Docker will pull this from Docker Hub if it‚Äôs not cached locally.

```yaml
    restart: always
```

* Ensures that if the container stops (crash, restart, etc.), it will always try to **restart automatically**.

```yaml
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
```

* These set up initial configuration for PostgreSQL:

  * `mydb` is the DB that gets created on startup
  * `user` and `pass` are the login credentials

```yaml
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

* Attaches a named **Docker volume** called `pgdata` to store data at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, which is Postgres's default data directory.
* This makes data **persist** even if the container is rebuilt or removed.

---

## ‚úÖ Volumes Section

```yaml
volumes:
  pgdata:
```

* Declares the volume named `pgdata`.
* Docker will **create and manage** this volume under the hood.
* Used by the `db` service to store its persistent data.

## üß† Summary

| Component            | Purpose                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build: .`           | Build the FastAPI image from Dockerfile                          |
| `depends_on: db`     | Ensure DB container starts before the app                        |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | Lets FastAPI connect to PostgreSQL using Compose DNS (`db:5432`) |
| `image: postgres:15` | Pulls and runs Postgres DB                                       |
| `volumes`            | Persists PostgreSQL data even after container stops or rebuilds  |
