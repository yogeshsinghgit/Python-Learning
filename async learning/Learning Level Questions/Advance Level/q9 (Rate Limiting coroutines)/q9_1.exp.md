## Rate-Limiting Coroutines with asyncio.Semaphore

To limit the number of concurrent tasks, we use asyncio.Semaphore(). This is useful when handling API requests, database connections, or background jobs where too many simultaneous tasks can overload the system.


## Code Explanation (q9_1)

Hereâ€™s how you can use `asyncio.Semaphore()` to implement rate-limiting and ensure that only **three coroutines run concurrently**:

---

### Code Example
```python
import asyncio
import random

async def limited_task(semaphore, task_id):
    """A task that acquires a semaphore to limit concurrency."""
    async with semaphore:  # Acquire the semaphore
        print(f"Task {task_id} is starting...")
        await asyncio.sleep(random.randint(1, 5))  # Simulate some work with random delay
        print(f"Task {task_id} has completed!")

async def main():
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(3)  # Limit to 3 concurrent tasks
    tasks = []

    # Create 10 tasks
    for i in range(10):
        tasks.append(limited_task(semaphore, i))

    # Run all tasks concurrently while respecting the semaphore limit
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

---

### Explanation:
1. **`asyncio.Semaphore(3)`**:
   - Creates a semaphore that allows up to **3 coroutines** to run concurrently.

2. **`async with semaphore`**:
   - Ensures that the coroutine acquires the semaphore before running.
   - The semaphore is released automatically after the coroutine completes, allowing another coroutine to take its place.

3. **Concurrency Management**:
   - Although 10 tasks are created, the semaphore restricts concurrency to a maximum of **3 tasks at a time**.
   - The others will wait until a semaphore is available.

4. **Simulating Work**:
   - Each task simulates work by sleeping for a random amount of time between 1 and 5 seconds.

5. **`asyncio.gather()`**:
   - Ensures that all tasks run concurrently while respecting the semaphore's limit.

---

### Sample Output:
The output will show tasks starting and completing, with at most 3 tasks running at any given time. For example:
```
Task 0 is starting...
Task 1 is starting...
Task 2 is starting...
Task 0 has completed!
Task 3 is starting...
Task 1 has completed!
Task 4 is starting...
Task 2 has completed!
...
```

This approach is particularly useful for rate-limiting scenarios like handling API requests, managing database connections, or processing data pipelines where you need to control the number of concurrent operations.
