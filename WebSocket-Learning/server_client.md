Absolutely! Let's go step-by-step through both the **WebSocket server** and **client** code using the latest version of the `websockets` library (v11+). I'll explain:

* What's happening at each line
* How the WebSocket lifecycle works
* How client and server interact

---

## 🖥️ **Server Code Explained**

```python
# server.py
import asyncio
import websockets
```

* `asyncio`: Python’s standard async I/O library.
* `websockets`: The library we use to implement WebSocket servers/clients.

---

### ✅ `echo` Function

```python
async def echo(websocket):
    async for message in websocket:
        print(f"Received: {message}")
        await websocket.send(f"Echo: {message}")
```

* **`websocket`**: Represents a single client connection. It’s a `WebSocketServerProtocol` object.
* `async for message in websocket`: Waits for messages from the client. As soon as a message arrives, it yields it.
* `await websocket.send(...)`: Sends a message back to the client.

➡️ This is a classic **echo server** — whatever message it receives, it sends back with a prefix.

---

### ✅ `main()` Function

```python
async def main():
    async with websockets.serve(echo, "localhost", 8765):
        print("WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8765")
        await asyncio.Future()  # Run forever
```

* `websockets.serve(...)`:

  * Sets up a WebSocket server.
  * Binds to `"localhost"` on port `8765`.
  * Uses `echo` to handle each connection.
* `async with`: Ensures the server is properly started and cleaned up.
* `await asyncio.Future()`: Keeps the server running forever. This is a trick to block without doing any work (since no real future will complete).

---

### ✅ Entry Point

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

* Starts the event loop and runs `main()`.

---

## 💻 **Client Code Explained**

```python
# client.py
import asyncio
import websockets
```

* Same imports — we’re creating a WebSocket **client** this time.

---

### ✅ `hello()` Function

```python
async def hello():
    uri = "ws://localhost:8765"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        await websocket.send("Hello WebSocket!")
        response = await websocket.recv()
        print(f"Response: {response}")
```

1. `uri = "ws://localhost:8765"`: WebSocket endpoint. Same as the server.
2. `websockets.connect(uri)`: Opens a connection to the server.
3. `await websocket.send(...)`: Sends a string message to the server.
4. `await websocket.recv()`: Waits for the server to send a message back.
5. `print(...)`: Displays the response from the server.

➡️ This client sends `"Hello WebSocket!"` and expects `"Echo: Hello WebSocket!"` in return.

---

### ✅ Entry Point

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(hello())
```

* Runs the `hello()` coroutine.

---

## 🔄 Full Lifecycle Flow

1. Server starts and listens on `ws://localhost:8765`.
2. Client connects to this address using `websockets.connect(...)`.
3. Server receives the connection and runs the `echo` handler with a `websocket` object.
4. Client sends a message: `"Hello WebSocket!"`.
5. Server receives it, prints it, and replies with `"Echo: Hello WebSocket!"`.
6. Client receives the response and prints it.

## 📊 Visual Summary

```
CLIENT                                     SERVER
--------                                   --------
connect ----------------------------->     accepts connection
send("Hello WebSocket!") ----------->     receive message
                                         print("Received: Hello WebSocket!")
                                         send("Echo: Hello WebSocket!")
recv()  <----------------------------     receive message
print("Echo: Hello WebSocket!")
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts You Just Used

* ✅ Async I/O with `async/await`
* ✅ WebSocket bidirectional communication
* ✅ Coroutine-based server/client using `websockets`
* ✅ Automatic handling of connection lifecycle

Let me know if you want to:

* Extend this to multiple clients (broadcast)
* Integrate frontend (browser-based WebSocket)
* Add authentication, reconnect logic, or message types
